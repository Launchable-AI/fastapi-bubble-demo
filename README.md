# Simple FastAPI server from tutorial video

This repo is the companion to this YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_klVVqvyNYQ

In this live-coding session, we create a FastAPI app, deploy it on AWS, and connect it to Bubble's API connector, worklow API, and data API.

Details about AWS setup coming soon.
